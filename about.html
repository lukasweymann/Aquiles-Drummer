            <h1 class="about-page__heading">Hey there, <br> I'm Aquiles. A professional drummer and instructor.</h1>
            <h6>I'm a chilean professional drummer and instructor. I started out as young as 4 years old! My father was my first teacher and that's how everything started. Once finishing highschool my heart was beating loud enough not to hear it, it said: study music. Our intuition is more often than we want right. It was more than a wise choice. Today I teach students and see them start out as I did and I can be part of that wonderful process where the love for music gets strenghtened. Playing as a professional musician is as exciting as teaching, and all of it requires high preparation.

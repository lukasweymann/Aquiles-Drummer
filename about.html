            <p class="about_paragraph">I'm a chilean professional drummer and instructor. I started out as young as 4 years old! My father was my first teacher and that's how everything started. Once finishing highschool my heart was beating loud enough not to hear it, it said: study music. Our intuition is more often than we want right. It was more than a wise choice. Today I teach students and see them start out as I did and I can be part of that wonderful process where the love for music gets strenghtened. Playing as a professional musician is as exciting as teaching, and all of it requires high preparation.

               <p class="about_paragraph">In the picture on the left of this paragraph I'm being interviewed for chilean TV. This is not about bragging now, just the opposite, this interview was at the time I was chosen as one of the 200 chileans with a big cultural influence for the country. This ocurrence took place at the celebretion of the 200th year since the chilean independence was first celebrated. Being chosen for such an honoring title made me come up with a plan: I want to go abroad and expand my knowledge in music, since I consider being a long-life-learner is crucial. I want to gather all the knowledge I can and come back to teach the kids and emerging musicians in my village. My biggest dream would be to become director of the orchestra where I started and give back all this knowledge to the coming generations, to express all the gratitude I feel for the lucky I have been encountering music at such a young age and having been able to get incredible support.
